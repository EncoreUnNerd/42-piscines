# 42 Piscine 🏊‍♂️

Welcome to my "42 Piscine" repository! This project showcases my coding journey during the piscine at École 42 🎓. Please note that not everything is complete or fully functional.

## About the Project

This repo contains all the “C ”s in my 42 piscine. The 42 piscine is the school's entrance exam. 1 month of “C” exercises. Just so you know, not all the codes are “perfect”, especially those towards the end that aren't specially put through the moulinette. I'd already coded before 42, but not in “C”, so this repo is a testament to my beginnings.

DON'T CLONE THIS PROJECT. As always, I recommend that you do it yourself, otherwise there's no point. This repo is there to keep track of the past. But if you ever want another perspective, it can also be useful.
