# 42 Piscine 🏊‍♂️

Welcome to my "42 Piscine" repository! This project showcases my coding journey during the piscine at École 42 🎓. Please note that not everything is complete or fully functional.

## About the Project

This repo contains all the “C ”s in my 42 piscine. The 42 piscine is the school's entrance exam. 1 month of “C” exercises. Just so you know, not all the codes are “perfect”, especially those towards the end that aren't specially put through the mill. I'd already coded before 42, but not in “C”, so this repo is a testament to my beginnings.

I VERY VERY strongly recommend that you don't look at what I've done until you've tried to do it yourself. And if you do, take WELL enough time to read and understand the written code sonon it won't be of any use to you.
